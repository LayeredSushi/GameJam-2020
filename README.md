# GameJam 2020
 A platformer game for 24h gamejam.

This is a co-project with Mykola Krupennyi.

The theme of the game jam was "It shouldn't be doing that". Our interpretation was that we have a mage that uses its staff to kill enemies. However, the staff behaves semi-randomly, such as turning enemies into iron golems or healing enemies instead of killing them.
